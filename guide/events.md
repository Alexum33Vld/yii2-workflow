# Events

*SimpleWorkflow* is making use of [Yii2 events](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-concept-events.html) to allow customization
of model behavior.  

Basically when something interesting happens to a model inside a workflow, an event is fired, or more precisely a **sequence of events** is
fired.

## Event Sequence

The default event sequence used by the *SimpleWorkflow* behavior is the *BasicEventSequence* available in the namespace 
`\raoul2000\workflow\events`. Below is a list of events fired by this sequence :

<table width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td><b>workflow event</b></td>
		<td><b>Basic Event Sequence</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>the model enters in workflow W1</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li><b>beforeEnterWorkflow{W1}</b></li>
				<li><b>beforeEnterStatus{W1/init}</b> where 'init' is the initial status Id for the workflow W1</li>
				<li><b>afterEnterWorkflow{W1}</b></li>
				<li><b>afterEnterStatus{W1/init}</b> where 'init' is the initial status Id for the workflow W1</li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>the model goes from status W1/A to W1/B</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li><b>beforeLeaveStatus{W1/A}</b></li>
				<li><b>beforeChangeStatusFrom{W1/A}to{W1/B}</b></li>
				<li><b>beforeEnterStatus{W1/B}</b></li>
				<li><b>afterLeaveStatus{W1/A}</b></li>
				<li><b>afterChangeStatusFrom{W1/A}to{W1/B}</b></li>
				<li><b>afterEnterStatus{W1/B}</b></li>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>the model leaves the workflow W1</td>
		<td>
			<ul>
				<li><b>beforeLeaveStatus{W1/B}</b> where W1/B is the last status Id of the model before it leaves the workflow</li>
				<li><b>beforeLeaveWorkflow{W1}</b></li>
				<li><b>afterLeaveStatus{W1/B}</b> where W1/B is the last status Id of the model before it leaves the workflow</li>
				<li><b>afterLeaveWorkflow{W1}</b></li></ul>
		</td>
	</tr>	
</table> 

Two other event sequences are also available in the same namespace :

- ReducedEventSequence
- ExtendedEventSequence

Of course you can create your own event sequence if the ones provided don't meet your needs. To do so, simply create a class that 
implements the `raoul2000\workflow\events\IEventSequence` interface.



## Configuration

When the *SimpleWorkflowBehavior* is initialized, it tries to get a reference to the **Event Sequence Component** to use. By default
this component is assumed to have the id *eventSequence*. If no such component is available, *it will create one* using the *BasicEventSequence* 
class and register it in the Yii2 application so to make it available to other *SimpleWorkflowBehavior*.

To summarize :
 
- **eventSequence** : default Id of the event sequence component used by the *SimpleWorkflowBehavior*
- **BasicEventSequence** : default event sequence type 

If for instance you want to use the *ReducedEventSequence* instead of the default one, you must configure it like you would do for 
any other Yii2 component.

```php
$config = [
    // ....
    'components' => [
    	// the default event sequence component is configured as a ReducedEventSequence
    	// and not a BasicEventSequence anymore 
        'eventSequence' => [
          'class' => '\raoul2000\workflow\events\ReducedEventSequence',
        ]
   // ...
```        

The *SimpleWorkflowBehavior* will then use the configured *eventSequence* component. 

You may also want to use a reduced event sequence for one particular workflow, and the basic event sequence with another ones. 
This can be easely achieved by configuring the ID of the event sequence component that a *SimpleWorkflowBehavior* should use.

In the example below we are first configuring a new component with the ID *myReducedEventSequence* and with type *ReducedEventSequence*.

```php
$config = [
    // ....
    'components' => [
        'myReducedEventSequence' => [
          'class' => '\raoul2000\workflow\events\ReducedEventSequence',
        ]
   // ...
```  

Now let's tell to the behavior of the Post model that it must use the *myReducedEventSequence* event sequence component configured above 
instead of the default one.

```php
<?php
namespace app\models;
class Post extends \yii\db\ActiveRecord
{
    public function behaviors()
    {
    	return [
			'class' => \raoul2000\workflow\base\SimpleWorkflowBehavior::className(),
			'eventSequence' => 'myReducedEventSequence'
    	];
    }
}
```

Any other model with a *SimpleWorkflowBehavior* will keep using the default Event sequence (*BasicEventSequence*) but the Post model
will use a specific one (*ReducedEventSequence*).

*SimpleWorkflow* events are enabled by default but can be disabled by setting the *eventSequence* configuration parameter to NULL when
attaching the behavior to the model. In this case as you may expect, no event is fired for this model.

```php
<?php
namespace app\models;
class Post extends \yii\db\ActiveRecord
{
    public function behaviors()
    {
    	return [
			'class' => \raoul2000\workflow\base\SimpleWorkflowBehavior::className(),
			'eventSequence' => null	// disable all SimpleWorkflow Events for Post instances
    	];
    }
}
```

## Event Handler

A event handler is used to implement specific process on any of the events in the event sequence. Installing an event handler is
a standard operation described in the [Yii2 Definitive Guide](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-concept-events.html#attaching-event-handlers). 

In the example below, we are attaching an handler for the event that is fired when a Post instance goes from the status *draft* to the
status *correction*. 

```php
use raoul2000\workflow\events\WorkflowEvent;

class Post extends \yii\db\ActiveRecord
{
	public function init()
	{
		$this->on(
			'afterChangeStatusFrom{PostWorkflow/draft}to{PostWorkflow/correction}', 
			[$this, 'sendMail']
		);
	}	
	
	public function sendMail($event) 
	{
		MailingService::sendMailToCorrector(
			'A Post is ready for correction',
			'The post [' . $event->sender->owner->title . '] is ready to be corrected.'
		);		
	}
```

## before vs after

Each event fired by the *SimpleWorkflowBehavior* can be of 2 types : **before** or **after**. The difference between these types is 
that a handler attached to a *before* event is able to block the transition in progress by *invalidating* the event. This is not possible
for a handler attached to a "after* event. Using this feature it becomes possible to block a transition based on the result of a complex
processing.

In the example below, an event handler is attached to be invoked *before* a Post instance enters into the status 'W1/A'. 
This handler checks that the user who is performing the action has the appropriate permission and if not it *invalidates* the event : the
Post instance will not be able to reach the status 'W1/A', the transition is blocked.

```php
use raoul2000\workflow\events\WorkflowEvent;

class Post extends \yii\db\ActiveRecord
{
	public function init()
	{
		$this->on(
			'beforeEnterStatus{W1/A}',
			function ($event) {
				// if the user doesn't have the current authorization, the transition to 'W1/A' is blocked
				$event->isValid = \Yii::$app->user->can('do.action');
			}
		);
	}	
	// .....
``` 

Event handlers attached to *before* events allow you to authorize or forbid a transition based on the result of a custom code execution.

## Event Name Helper

The class *\raoul2000\workflow\events\WorkflowEvent* includes a set of static method that you can use to easely create workflow event names.
It's even more useful if your favorite IDE supports auto-completion ! The example below is equivalent to the previous one except that
the event name is created at runtime by a call to `WorkflowEvent::beforeEnterStatus('W1/A')`.

```php
$this->on(
	// use the event helper to generate the event name 
	WorkflowEvent::beforeEnterStatus('W1/A'),
	function ($event) {
		// ...
	}
);
```
