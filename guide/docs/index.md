# What is yii2-workflow ?

**yii2-workflow** is an extension of the [Yii2 Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/), designed to help you manage workflow in your app. It is the successor of *[simpleWorkflow](http://s172418307.onlinehome.fr/project/sandbox/www/index.php?r=simpleWorkflow/page&view=home)* which was developed some years ago for the 1.x version of Yii. Both extensions try to keep thing simple and easy to use. They rely as much as possible on standard Yii2 features like Events, components, behaviors, etc.

Before going any further in your reading it is important to understand what yii2-workflow is *not* :

- it is not a complete and complex workflow engine
- it does not provide any UI components (basically it's a *behavior* that you add to your *ActiveRecord* models)
- it is not a solution to all your problems (I whish it would though)


# How can it be useful ?

As obvious as it seems, it is useful when dealing with workflow ! If you have no idea what a workflow
is then you should maybe start reading the [intro]() section and discover the wonderful world of workflows.

# Requirements and Prerequisites

Well, the only requirement here is to have installed the latest version of the [Yii2 Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) (or at least a version greater or equal to 2.0.3).
