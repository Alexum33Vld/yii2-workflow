# Concepts

Before being able to use *SimpleWorkflow* there are some simple key concepts that you must know.

## What is SimpleWorkflow

*SimpleWorkflow* is a set on objects dedicated to help managing the life-cycle of an ActiveRecord
model within a *workflow*.

It includes :

- a behavior (*SimpleWorkflowBehavior*)
- a Workflow Source Component (*WorkflowPhpSource*) supporting 2 workflows formats (for now)
- a Validator (*WorkflowValidator*)
- three event sequence models
- various helpers 

*SimpleWorkflow* can be configure to fit your requirements and if that's not enough, you can extend all classes so to
implement your own features.

## Identifiers

The *SimpleWorkflow* refers to workflows and statuses using identifiers. The way these identifiers are formatted, depends 
on the *WorkflowSource* components used. 


## Initial Status

The initial status is the first status assigned to a model, that's the *entry point* into a workflow. Each
workflow must have exactly one initial status.

For example, in a workflow dedicated to manage posts, the initial status could be called 'draft' : it usually
describes the first state of the post. 


## Transition

A transition is a *directed* link between two statuses : the *start* status and the *end* status (the words
'source' and 'target' are also used).

For example, if we define a transition between the status 'draft' and 'published', a post with status 'draft' (the start status) is able to
reach status 'published' (the end status), but not the opposite.

## Workflow Source

The *Workflow Source* is a component responsible for providing workflow, status and transitions objects based on a formatted workflow definition.


## Events

The *SimpleWorkflow* is making use of [Yii2 events](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-concept-events.html) to allow customization
of model behavior.
